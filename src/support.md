# Support

For questions that are not answered by the [tutorial](tutorial.md), the API
reference for the relevant [release](release.md), or the
[examples](examples.md), there are a few avenues for getting additional
support.

Questions that lend themselves to be formulated in a concise and general way
can be made into a [Q&A
topic](https://github.com/evalf/nutils/discussions/categories/q-a), where both
developers and advanced users can weigh in their answers, and where they may be
of benefit to others encountering the same issue. Be sure to check first if
your issue was not discussed already!

If you believe that you have spotted a bug, the best thing to do is to file an
[issue](https://github.com/evalf/nutils/issues). Issues should contain a
description of the problem, the expected behaviour, and steps to reproduce,
including the version of Nutils that the issue relates to. If you believe that
the bug was recently introduced you can help the developers by identifying the
first failing commit, for instance using
[bisection](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect).

Finally, for general discussions, questions, suggestions, or just to say hello,
everybody is welcome to join the nutils-users support channel at
[#nutils-users:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#nutils-users:matrix.org). Note
that you will need to create an account at any Matrix server in order to join
this channel.
