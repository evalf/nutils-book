# Release History

Nutils is developed on [Github](https://github.com/evalf/nutils) and released
at cadence of roughly one year, with the actual time of release depending on
the level of maturity of newly introduced features. Major releases introduce
new features and may deprecate features that have been superceded. Minor
releases contain only bugfixes and are always safe to upgrade to.

Every major release follows the following procedure:

- The development branch is branched off to release/x, where x is the major
  version number
- The release is assigned a code name, in alphabetical order, derived from a
  type of noodles dish 
- The release commit is [tagged](https://github.com/evalf/nutils/releases) as
  vx.0, with minor updates following as vx.1, vx.2 etc
- The package is uploaded to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/nutils/) for easy
  installation using pip
- The changelog in the development branch is emptied and added to this release
  history

## Development version

Since Nutils is under active development and releases are fairly infrequent,
users may choose to work with the development version directly, taking for
granted that their code may require continuous updating as features develop â€”
keep an eye on the changelog in the project root! The development version is
continuously updated here:
