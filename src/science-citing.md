# Citing Nutils

To acknowledge Nutils in publications, authors are encouraged to cite the
specific version of Nutils that was used to generate their results. To this
end, Nutils releases are assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) by
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6006701) which can be used for citations.
For instance, a bibliography entry for Nutils 7.0 could look like this:

- J.S.B. van Zwieten, G.J. van Zwieten, W. Hoitinga. (2022). Nutils 7.0.
  _Zenodo_. DOI [10.5281/zenodo.6006701](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6006701).

For LaTeX documents, the corresponding bibtex entry would be:

```bibtex
@misc{nutils7,
  title = {Nutils 7.0},
  author = {van Zwieten, J.S.B. and van Zwieten, G.J. and Hoitinga, W.},
  publisher = {Zenodo},
  year = {2022},
  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.6006701},
}
```

Note that Zenodo can additionally host and assign a DOI to code that is
specific to the publication, which is a great way to share digital artifacts
and ensure reproducibility of the research.
